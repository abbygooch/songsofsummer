            <li><strong>My Review:</strong> <span>When this song first came out I didn't like it. I thought (and rightfully so) that the lyrics were cheap and the song was an earworm. And then it got stuck in my head, so I had no choice but to continue to listen to it. Sabrina, you have done it again.</span></li>
            <li><strong>My Rating:</strong> <span>9 of 10 stars!</span></li>
