            <li><strong>My Review:</strong> <span>I want to give this song 5 stars so bad. I seriously love it, great work Sabrina, but could no one in that writing room come up with something better than little sucker? The clean version of that song is absolutely ridiculous. "I beg you don't embarass me like the others" would've worked perfectly. Or "I beg you don't embarass me or you'll suffer". I'm just saying, there were options.</span></li>
            <li><strong>My Rating:</strong> <span>8 of 10 stars!</span></li>
