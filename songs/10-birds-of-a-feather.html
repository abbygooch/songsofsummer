            <li><strong>Performer:</strong> <span>Billie Eilish</span></li>
            <li><strong>My Review:</strong> <span>I have been a fan of Billie since 2017, and this song did not disappoint. It makes me think of Rio (the bird movie) which I love, but it's not like Rio because the lyrics are mildly unsettling if you really listen to them!</span></li>
            <li><strong>My Rating:</strong> <span>9 of 10 stars!</span></li>
