            <li><strong>Performer:</strong> <span>Post Malone featuring Morgan Wallen</span></li>
            <li><strong>My Review:</strong> <span>I was disappointed but not suprised to see this song in the number one position. Maybe I would have enjoyed this song in another life where it didn't play on every radio station and inside every public building in America for the entire summer. My sincerest apologies to Post Malone and Morgan Wallen, but it's a no from me.</span></li>
            <li><strong>My Rating:</strong> <span>2 of 10 stars!</span></li>
