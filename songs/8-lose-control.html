            <li><strong>My Review:</strong> <span>I have a confession to make. I thought that this song was by Jelly Roll. I really didn't know. So, yeah, sorry Mr. Swims. Obviously I have not listened to this song a ton, but I have no qualms that come to mind.</span></li>
            <li><strong>My Rating:</strong> <span>6 of 10 stars!</span></li>
